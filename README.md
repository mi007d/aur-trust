# aur-trust
With AUR trust you can verify:
  - Package name
  - Package URL
  - Votes
  - Popularity

So you don't need to visit aur.archlinux.org every time you have to download an package with yay.

# How it works?
Arch Linux offers the AURweb RPC interface, so we can read a JSON response and "extract" some properties.

# End
Feel free to improve and fork :)

<sub><sup>i'm learning Python. It's a very basic code to help me with yay installations, so i can verify if i'm not downloading the wrong package.</sup></sub>
